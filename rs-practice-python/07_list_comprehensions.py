Exercise 5 : 
---------------------------------------------------------
Let's say I gave you a list saved in a variable: 
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one 
line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new 
list that has only the even elements of this list in it
-----------------------------------------7---------------
Concepts :

1. List comprehensions: The idea of list comprehension 
  is to make code more compact to accomplish tasks involving 
  lists. 
  eg: ages = [2014 - year for year in year_of_birth]
